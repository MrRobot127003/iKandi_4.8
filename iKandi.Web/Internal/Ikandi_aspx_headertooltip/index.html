             Foc challan:-<br />
              <span style="padding-left:50px;display: inline-block;">---> FOC Stands for the free of charge. In case where the processor has done some malfunctioning and the fabric issued for processing get wasted partially 
                 or complete, Now the processor is asking for the same quantity of the previous stage to process again even he is agreeing to pay the debit against the base fabric.
                  Following are the important points:</span><br />
                  <span style="padding-left:70px;display: inline-block;margin-top: 10px;">* Now FOC link with all the PO’s other than first stage PO.</span><br />
                  <span style="padding-left:70px;display: inline-block;margin-top: 10px;">* This link will appear in the Manage PO screen in the Challan section, until unless the PO is not closed. Removed : complete   quantity is not received in SRV. </span><br />
                  <span style="padding-left:70px;display: inline-block;margin-top: 10px;">* When click on the FOC then the send challan will open, and it will show the total send quantity till now for the PO.
                                                      Here it will show you the Stock available quantity too.in case if it is open from the FOC link, It will ask for Stock Challan Qty and Reverse stock Challan Qty both.</span><br />
                  <span style="padding-left:70px;display: inline-block;margin-top: 10px;">* Previous total Challan quantity will be shown for the validation so that in FOC, User will not send the extra quantity than previously raised total challan to the supplier, 
                                                     Here we can give the po specific extra FOC % column and by default its value would be 0 if the material manager need he can allow the extra issuing of FOC by changing the %. 
                                                     Total Challan quantity will not include the FOC Challan quantity. 
                                                     We showed the Total FOC challan quantity too as there may be multiple FOC Challans as well.</span><br />
                  <span style="padding-left:70px;display: inline-block;margin-top: 10px;">* We also need to store the Challan quantity and the latest max previous stage rate for raising the Debit. So that whenever Debit is raised the FOC debit also get listed. 
                                                     If few quantities are reversed from FOC challan, then this also need to be managed in debit too.</span><br />
                  <span style="padding-left:70px;display: inline-block;margin-top: 10px;">* If the FOC Challan is done for the 3rd stage, then it means in FOC there will be second stage Stock quantity so the Rate for debit will include as follows  
                                                     i.(Greige shrinkage adjusted rate of first stage) + (Max Process Rate latest)</span><br />
                  <span style="padding-left:70px;display: inline-block;margin-top: 10px;">* If second stage and we are raising the FOC of first stage stock then consider max latest rate of previous stage quality, to avoid any losses.</span><br />
                  <span style="padding-left:70px;display: inline-block;margin-top: 10px;">* We were showing the actual calculated rate in debit, but it will be editable in debit note. We will store the latest previous rate and current rate both.</span><br />
                   <span style="padding-left:70px;display: inline-block;margin-top: 10px;">* So, the complete outcome is that in case of FOC we can issue a challan of max total send quantity till date without FOC and this cannot exceed the availability limit in the stock for the said fabric quality of previous said stage.</span>
                    <span style="padding-left:70px;display: inline-block;margin-top: 10px;"> *The complete FOC Challan quantity will be liable for the debit and the data with comments will get stored in a table which will appear in any of the debit created against the PO number.</span>
                     <span style="padding-left:70px;display: inline-block;margin-top: 10px;">* One PO Multiple FOC Challan can be created. We also need to have tracking that is the Debit note is raised for particular or not.
                Always consider those FOC’s in Debit for which Debit is not raised yet.</span>

             <span style="padding-left:50px;margin-top: 10px;">* The allocated extra quantity will be available for extra cut entry and the entries in the further stitching and finishing as usual.</span><br />
             <span style="padding-left:50px;margin-top: 10px;">* Here for the cutting entry as by default we allow the 2% of the Order quantity extra.</span><br />
             <span style="padding-left:50px;margin-top: 10px;">* Here we will show the Stock available quantity, Extra issuing to production and Reverse from Extra issuing.

             <li>Now in this flow PD can select “Finalise with Sample” or “Finalise with out sample” Option. Based on the options Sample sent task created or not.</li>
		    <li>The Cycle can be initiated as many time as required until Order not placed.</li>
		    <li>If Order placed and any Cycle is in between then that cycle need to be follow same flow.</li>
		    <li>In Pattern based only till Patter Ready task get created.</li>
			<li>If required the Sample for pattern based style then need to change the type as Sample based for the style this can be done by PD own or with the help of the IT support.</li>
		    <li>Master auto allocation is done automatically and can be updated by Gulbas too.</li>

                     <li>Add one more column as “PP sample sent” in first grid. Here if the checkbox is not applicable then we will
                      show NA for the particular account managers otherwise we will show the total count of  PP sample sent in last 3 months.</li>
                      <li>In second grid first section of PO upload we are adding one more column as "Average PO Upload Time" This is in week.

                <li>Here the Initial factor is calculated based on the initial rate given by the vendors which are not finalised.

Those contracts whose cut date is among last 90 days.</li>
                <li>To calculate the Production Factor same logic used as above but we consider only those style codes which have the finalised rate with some vendor. So, based on the vendor and their finalised rates on style code be the part of the average production Factor. Rate need to be divided by SAM. Those contracts whose cut date is among last 90 days.</li>

                    <li>If there first stitch entry then manpower is added and if later entries are done in next 2 to 5 days then, the previous entered manpower count will repeat until unless new manpower entry is not done.</li>
                    <li>So, by this way for all days there will be the Manpower and we can calculate the average manpower used for outhouse factories.</li>

                        <li>If style code total quantity from new order to approve to ex is less than 2000 then Multiply factor would be 2.5</li>

                        <li>Another column delay days is also added in the “Vendor factor Summary Report”. Here based on the committed end date and actual end date delays in days are calculated and shown as an average for the particular vendors. </li>

            <li> <strong> Planned For Shipping </strong>
              <ul>
                <li>We have first worked on the Mode Admin for selecting the delivery week days for the different active delivery modes.
                  This allow to select from Monday to Saturday.</li>
                <li> Now we take all the unshipped orders which Ex-factory is less than or equals to Today date + 10 days as  used for News Letter.</li>
                <li> We are also considering those contracts whose stitch complete more than 90%. </li>
                <li> Now for these contracts based on their stitch end date and shipping days defined in the mode admin, nearest delivery mode day date just 
                  after stitch end date will  be considered as planned for ship date. </li>
                <li> Here end date is calculated on same logic as if production day less than 4th day then end date calculated based on 80% efficiency defined in CMT Admin as
                  <ul>
                    <li> Available Minutes = Planned OB * 60 </li>
                    <li> Per Hour Pcs. = (Available Minutes / Planned SAM) * (Day Efficiency * 80%) </li>
                    <li> Days = (Pending Stitch Quantity / Per Hour Pcs.) / 8 </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li> If Production day is greater than 3rd day then we do calculation of day based on last 4 hours average output and consider the working hours as 11.25 hours. </li>
                <li> If Contract is not planned then showing <strong>Un Planned</strong> and freeze. </li>
                <li> If contracts are planned and stitching not started then <strong>Pending to stitch</strong> and freeze. </li>
                <li> If stitch started then default Mode will be Auto and Scheduler will do the planned day calculation every day. </li>
                <li> If manual selected scheduler will not handle the dates. In Manual mode PPC team can pre pone or post pone the ship plan date. </li>
                <li> In case when planning done for unplanned contracts at the same time its status will be changed to Pending to stitch. </li>
                <li>On first stitch entry Planned for date get calculated automatically.</li>
                <li>This feature is given in the MO production section.</li>

                <li>The first entry date will be the start date and based on the first entry and total allocation, end date get updated. 
                  If in later stages new entry comes then it gets the average of the working days from start and based on this end date get updated.
                  e.g.
                  <ul>
                    <li> first entry done on 21 November then start date will be 21 November, 
                      total allocation is 5000 and first entry is 500 then according to calculation end date will be Start date + 10 working Days. </li>
                    <li> If again entry done on 22 November then  first take average of 2 days and then based on this and total quantity allocated end date recalculated and updated </li>

            <li> <strong>Line Planning</strong>
              <ul>
                <li> Now Line planning based on style code. Now many styles, their serial numbers, 
                  contracts of a style code can be plan simultaneously in single frame. </li>
                <li>Now during planning just make the entry of the style code 
                  and based on this all the styles their serial numbers and contracts listed and by 
                  selecting the individuals can be planned in single frame only. </li>
                <li>Sequential and parallel planning should be available with all the frames. 
                  By default all the planning will be Sequential but this can be selected as parallel too. 
                  In case of selection parallel this will ask to which frame and if frame selected then its start and end date will follow the base frame. </li>
                <li>Until unless production not started use the production efficiencies 80% (as defined in the CMT Admin) for the planning purpose. </li>
                <li>We need to provide the SAM selection in the frame if different styles of a style code is planned. </li>
                <li>Now similarly we have to provide the OB selection as well as amendment in the OB too for the particular frame. 
                  So, in case if production is not started we can use the Selected SAM, Selected/entered OB and day efficiency as 80% (as defined in the CMT Admin) of the planned. </li>
                <li>By default sequence arrangement for visibility will be based on ex-factory and quantity also following the MO ordering sequence. </li>
                <li>Now when production starts then this takes the overall output 
                  reference from the line, unit and style code of last 4 hours average and based on this the frame end date get updated automatically. </li>
                <li>When doing planning then on selection of style code all the styles and contracts to be planned should be listed and planner can select few of them in one go. </li>
                <li>Frame planning can be editable and if the contracts are not started can be removed and other can be added. </li>

            <li> <strong>Production Matrix Update</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>In the planning matrix following the planning contract sequence. </li>
                <li>The sequence defined in the planning for the contracts should be used and all the planning should be done based on the 
                  80% (As defined in the CMT admin) of the production efficiency for those days where actual production is not coming. </li>
                <li> Whenever actual efficiency arrive this will overwrite the planning efficiency. </li>
                <li>Whichever contract of the plan is getting stitched but the planning matrix will consider the day quantity and 
                  use in the same sequence as defined in the planning. </li>
                <li> In the planning matrix no need to show the ETA, In-house, 
                  Average and required. All can be considered in hidden to calculate for the shortage and color combinations. </li>
                <li>For prior to stitch condition need to use the planning SAM and OB here. </li>
                <li> At the time when stitching started then use the planning SAM and actual OB used. </li>
                <li>In House will be the sum of in house based on style code and fabric. </li>
                <li> As the productivity or according to planning pcs made in matrix requirement matrix will response </li>
                <li>Add hours to adjust will be removed. Because until unless we are no reaching to
                  30% efficiency the working hour will be 8 hours and after achieving 30% or more this will be 11.25 hrs.</li>
                <li>Regarding production matrix now we will not show the ETA in the production matrix grid. As this will not come in correct any case. </li>
                <li> The production matrix will work on the overall style code on a line. </li>
                <li> For each individual fabric + color/print combination separate column will get created. </li>
                <li> Similarly for the accessories too. </li>
                <li>If style code is planned in full stitch in two frames then we are giving option to select the particular frame to see the planning matrix.</li>
                <li> For each individual fabric + Color /Print combination separate columns get created. Similarly this is done for all individual accessories. </li>
                <li>Planning matrix will follow the same sequence defined in the frame. </li>
                <li>Always works on the overall style code output for the frame. </li>
                <li>In Half stitch using Planning SAM and Planning OB. If actual OB present then use this. </li>
                <li> If color is white then the particular fabric or accessory is not in use for the contract. Green if fulfil the requirement else red. </li>
                <li> For half stitch quantity logic is as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>If only planning then we consider the complete SAM and OB and plan in the range of min
                      start date and max end date of the two frames. We use the overall quantity. </li>
                    <li>Finally using the formulae as : <br/>
                      <strong>Minimum QTY + (First SAM QTY – Minimum QTY)*First SAM/ Total SAM + (Second SAM QTY – Minimum QTY)*Second SAM/ Total SAM</strong> </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

            <li> <strong>Hourly Report Update</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Now Hourly Report is compatible with the current development of the Line planning. </li>
                <li>Working Hour is based on the efficiency achieved. If it is &lt;= 30 % then 8 Hrs and if eff. &gt; 30% then 11.25 working hrs. are considered. </li>
                <li> Projection is applied based on last 4 hrs. output. </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li> Now there are two options for the style number creation. For this purpose 2 radio buttons added as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Use default style sequence:</strong> In this case auto incremented design code generated from the system. Here no significance of the designer code in this option.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Use open style:</strong> Here by using this option any of the number can be used as a design code. Only duplicity check is applied here. </li>
                    <img src="direct-design.jpg" width="100%" />
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Tech Pack Upload Option </li>
                <li> Now in the design form we are providing an option to upload the tech packs too. Further the uploaded tech packs will be available in the costing sheet too. </li>
                <img src="tech-pack-upload.jpg" width="100%" />
                <li> Various type of costing option is implemented as follows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Now there are three radio buttons are implemented in the bottom just beside the submit button. Named as
                      <ul>
                        <li> Direct Costing ( No sample or Patterns required in this case)</li>
                        <li> Pattern Based Costing ( In this type Pattern making is required)</li>
                        <li> Sample based Costing (In this type Sample making is required) </li>
                      </ul>
                      By Default Sample based costing will remain selected. </li>

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Workflow will be as below:

                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> <strong> Fits Module update:</strong> Here task remain same as STC unallocated. UI get changed a bit. MO will also be changed now in MO if you want to do navigation, then click on STC and you will be on history page and in the bottom a link will be available which will further navigate to you on New Fits form. <br/>
              <img src="stc-tchnical.jpg" /> <br/>
              After click on the STC you will navigate to the History page having navigation link to move you in fit form <br/>
              <img src="fits-sampling.jpg" width="100%" /><br/>
              Now when click on the above link we will move to the fits form. Snap is attached below and you can work only in the red closed area of the snap:<br/>
              <img src="fits-sampling-history.jpg" width="100%" /><br/>
              Here in the big red square area is the focus area for the IKANDI users.<br/>
              If you see here there are few new tasks are increased pattern as hand over and Patter ready which is going to make more specific in STC task flow in depth. <br/>
              You can directly navigate from the tasks too. <br/>
              <img src="direct-fits-sample.jpg" width="100%" /> </li>
            <li> <strong>Pattern Ready</strong> task need to be done by CAD Manager (Gulbas) He can do individually by task and also can be do this multiple one time from a separate URL provided.</li>
            <li> <strong>Sample sent</strong> and <strong>Hand Over</strong> in case of <strong>pre order</strong> sampling need to be done by <strong>PD merchant</strong> and <strong>PD manager</strong>. </li>
            <li> <strong>Sample sent</strong> and <strong>Hand Over</strong> in case of <strong>post order</strong> fits need to be done by <strong>Production Merchant</strong> and <strong>Account Manager</strong>. </li>
            <li> At the time of Hand Over task done Create OB and Verify Costing Tasks created in Post order. Same happens in case of Pre Order too but there should be Price quoted done. </li>
            <li> Costing version can be created and at that time this will ask the option like with sample or without sample. In case of without sample everything is copied from base costing and in case of with sample pop up ask for removal of few sections data and if selected this get removed from new version and Hand Over task created for this. </li>
            <img src="costing-variation.jpg" />
            <li> The most important screen for rescheduling the styles. Changing the priority and also to change the association with the particular master. This is used by CAD Manager (Gulbas) <br/>
              This is very important screen to manage all the styles in patter creation. Search features are also provided. </li>
            <img src="schedule-pattern-master.jpg" width="100%" />
            <li> At the time of sample sent it’s mandatory to select the QC and checkbox both.</li>
            <li> In case of Pre Order during sample sent upload document is not mandatory but in case pf Post order this is mandatory.</li>
            <li> Sample achieved task is removed now.</li>
            <li> All existing sample achieved tasks are moved in Hand Over after discussion with PD department.</li>
            <li> Migration has also taken place as discussed.</li>
            <li> During allocation following flow of process is used:</li>

                <li> Inspection Detail, Faults and remarks will appear for highest stitch output contract of a group. </li>
                <li> For inspection only two latest data will appear. As the latest inspection done detail and next pending inspection detail only. </li>
                <li> Stitch close, Finish close, half stitch close and day close will work only all the contracts of a group follow the specific rule. </li>
                <li> Ex-factory date will appear for highest stitch output contract of a group. </li>
                <li> Agreed Ob of Stitching would be in Grey colour. </li>
                <li> We have to use softer colours in same shade as of now for back ground colour of the serial numbers. </li>
                <li> In Stitching Section Peak Capacity would be blue and bold. </li>
                <li> In Stitching section Peak Ob and Peak Efficiency will be Grey. </li>
                <li> Finishing SAM need to be removed in finishing section. </li>

                <li> Finishing Peak OB would be Grey. </li>
                <li> Finishing Peak Efficiency need to be removed. </li>
                <li> In Finishing Section for press and TC All will be grey except the actual OB colour will depend on the Peak OB. (i.e. if press actual OB &gt; press Peak OB then red else it will be green). </li>
                <li> WIP should come up to 1 decimal places round off.</li>
                <li> DHU % section and Today efficiency section will swap their places. </li>
                <li> Check and correct the fabric quantity. </li>
                <li> If Style Eff is &gt; = Break Even Eff then Background colour would be Green else Red. </li>
                <li> Performance formula will be reversed as follows: <br/>
                  <strong> ((Average Finishing Pcs * Latest Finishing OB)/ (Finishing Peak OB * Finishing Peak Capacity))*100</strong> </li>

                <li> Now in hourly report whole day the DHU faults with count will be visible except 3rd slot where latest QC faults will appear in report. </li>
                <li> We need to add the stitching cost and Finishing Cost with WIP in the hourly Report. For this first in CMT Admin define Stitching, Finishing per OB per HR cost. Actual Formula as: <br/>
                  <strong>Stitching Cost = (Actual OB * Stitching per OB per HR cost)/Average Pcs</strong> <br/>
                  <strong>Finishing Pcs = (Actual OB * Finishing per OB per HR cost)/Average Pcs</strong> <br/>
                  Cost colour would be in grey </li>
                <li> Now CMT admin updated for maintaining the <strong>Stitching per OB per HR cost and Finishing per OB per HR cost</strong> </li>

            <li>For WIP now last day stitch/ finish need to be consider based on the style code in spite of contract. If finish quantity is not present for last day then consider the last day stitch quantity. </li>
            <li>During WIP calculation If Last day stitch and finish not present then based on 3rd day efficiency of production use the stitch quantity and based on that calculate the WIP. Formulae used as follows: <br/>
              <strong>(Latest OB * 8 * 60)/ SAM</strong> will be the expected quantity last day in above case. </li>
            <li>Stitch entry screen for IE will also get updated now. Now IE will also make entry for the Pressing and Thread Cutting details too. Updated stitching entry screen is as follows: <br/>
              <img src="stitch-entry.png" width="100%" /> <br/>
              During Stitching entry for finishing IE will add the total finish OB, Thread Cut OB, Press OB,  Peak Total OB, Peak Thread Cut OB, Peak Press OB, Peak Total Capacity, Peak TC Capacity and Peak Press Capacity </li>

  <div class=" ver-main-conte">
    <h6> Released Date:17-Jan-2015</h6>
    <p> Changes in Manage Order Form,Limitation Form and ETA in each section of MO</p>
    <p> <b> PCD: </b> </p>
    <p> 1.PCD date calculations have now been formulated so as to show a PRECISE PCD date,
      which all NEED TO FOLLOW.</p>
    <p> -: Ex-factory date change which may be a result of DC date change</p>
    <p> -: Bulk-In-House target change (delay beyond system target). </p>
    <p> <b> ORDER LIMITATION FORM: </b> </p>
    <p> 1.This section now removes the requirement of the production department to provide
      any limitation or sign. Merchandising, Fabric & Accessory Dept. to continue this
      procedure.</p>
    <p> 2.Fabric department - The Bulk ETA is a logical calculated date which is derived
      from the date of the order and the date of ex-factory/PCD.</p>
    <p> 3.The number of days from order date (fabric lead time) till Bulk ETA shall be shown
      in a box below each fabric.</p>
    <p> 4.Fabric department can change this date in view of their supplier limitation, however
      if this number (of days) increases, this will impact the costed CMT (this change
      shall be seen on the upcoming release 5.10) and also push the PCD closer to the
      ex-factory date, which has a negative impact on production days available vis-a-vis
      the ex-factory, maybe requiring an increase in the lines and/or increasing OB workstations
      also, which will increase the CMT and cause losses in production.</p>
    <p> <b> Manage Orders (M.O.): </b> </p>
    <p> 1.The look of the M.O. has changed essentially with below changes and by reducing
      white spaces to optimise the view to a comfort screen-fit for easy and complete
      view</p>
    <p> 2.Basic Info Section:“Buyer PO Pending” is seen towards the bottom of this section
      in red, till such time the Merchandiser does not upload the buyer’s P.O (from order
      form). This is an FYI information only and once P.O. is uploaded this comment shall
      vanish.</p>
    <p> -: PP Meeting form link is now available in this section by clicking the Serial number
      (along with the order form, fabric order form etc., at bottom of existing list)..</p>
    <p> <b>3.FABRIC SECTION: </b>The fabric section has changes in the look.</p>
    <p> <b> -: New inclusions : </b> Start ETA of Bulk and End ETA of bulk are 2 new date fields included
      next to each fabric for inputting latest information on the fabric to be received
      - this is an important and compulsory entry.</p>
    <p> -: Upon entering the final meterage count (100% or more) the date of such entry will
      automatically show next to the percentage to show the date of fabric completion</p>
    <p> <b> 4.ACCESSORY SECTION: </b> The accessory section has changes in the look.</p>
    <p> -: Similar to the fabric section the user is required to input an ETA against each
      accessory, however there is only one ETA required in this section, which is the
      End ETA. This is an important and compulsory entry</p>
    <p> -:Upon entering the final meterage or count (100% or more) the date of this entry
      will automatically show next to the percentage</p>
    <p> <b> 5.TECHNICL SECTION: </b> This section has various and important changes in the look as
      well as functionality.</p>
    <p> -: This comprises of 2 sub-sections:</p>
    <p> -: TECHNICAL (PROD):</p>
    <p> -: PCD date is now system calculated based on SAM/OB/available minutes and is hence
      PRECISE. This date needs to be respected and honoured by all departments</p>
    <p> <b>-: SAM: </b> The latest SAM value can be viewed here, be it the Costing SAM or the Production
      SAM, it will be shown with the correct narrative.</p>
    <p> <b> -: OB: </b> Similarly the latest OB count can be viewed here, be it the Costing OB or
      the Production OB, it will be shown with the correct narrative.</p>
    <p> <b> -: OB file: </b> The blue hyperlink next to the OB shall be clickable, and here one can
      view the latest OB file (whether Costing or Production - whichever has been entered
      latest).</p>
    <p> <b> -: Available minutes : </b> The available minutes (in lakhs) to produce the particular
      contract (not complete Style) is calculated to precision and shown next to the OB.</p>
    <p> <b> -: Lines : </b> The number of lines required to produce the ENTIRE STYLE (not just the
      viewed contract) is calculated and shown here, this is also quite optimised to the
      nearest count.</p>
    <p> -: The difference between the ex-factory date and the PCD date is set at 7 days,
      which essentially takes care of the time for cutting and finishing / packing to
      achieve the ex-factory date.</p>
    <p> -: For STC, Graded, Pattern/Sample and TOP, a driven target date is initially provided
      for every new order based on PCD date and the user needs to replace with correct
      ETA’s from time to time</p>
    <p> -: This is to be entered via a pop-up box for each field, which will show all contracts
      on the style, and also allow user to feed their remarks.</p>
    <p> -: User needs to enter ETA’s for Cutting Sheet and Production file (no system driven
      entry - blank) - however these are through a calendar entry and no pop-up is available/required
      for remarks.</p>
    <p> -: The QA status pop-up box does NOT exist any longer as it was redundant.</p>
    <p> 6. <b> PRODUCTION SECTION: </b> The look of this section has also changed and sections re-aligned.</p>
    <p> -: The ex-factory date and the mode is now shown at the top.</p>
    <p> -: This is now THE FINAL FINAL ex-factory date with ZERO BUFFER. We all need to ensure
      this date is met as no extensions/manipulations possible (penalty starts after this
      date).</p>
    <p> -: The background colour (green, orange, red) of this section has now been removed.
      However, in case the FINAL ex-factory is missed, this section with go RED.</p>
    <p> -: The production section consisting of:'cut' which requires only the cut start date
      to be entered (this is part of release 5.10) and shall presently show a blank field
      (deemed to be same as PCD date) .</p>
    <p> -: cut ready requires 2 entries - cut ready start ETA and cut ready end ETA.</p>
    <p> -: Stitch also requires 2 entries - stitch start ETA and stitch end ETA.</p>
    <p> -: Similarly V.A. also requires 2 entries - V.A. start ETA and V.A. end ETA
      - THIS SECTION REQUIRES AN ENTRY FOR ALL VALUE ADDITIONS LIKE ADDA, HAND EMB. GARMENT
      PRINTING, WASHING ETC.</p>
    <p> -: packed requires just 1 entry which is the end ETA of packing.</p>
    <p> -: Just below this section is the shipment offer date which is entered by the production
      department in their regular production planning file and is also viewed here.</p>

  <h2 class=" main-heading"> Version 5.8</h2>
  <div class=" ver-main-conte">
    <h6> Released Date:8-Jan-2015</h6>
    <p> 1.Changes in Fabric Order Form, Costing sheet and MO</p>
    <p> 2.Cut Avg once filled on MO, will be rolled back on the fabric order form and the
      costing sheet. The person filling the cut avg will have the option to update cut
      
      average for single contract or all contracts for this style number + fabric quality
      + print/color combo.</p>
    <p> 3.Fabric order form will get roll back of cut average and new quantities required
      by cutting will be updated. It will create a task on dashboard, in case cut average
      is less or more than the fabric ordered average. This helps the fabric dept to control
      the order qty with the supplier and see what can be done to increase/reduce.</p>
    <p> 4.Costing form will get roll back of cut average and also the correct fabric quality
      name and color/print. Any reduction or increase in fabric expense will be adjusted
      with the profit margin and an acknowledge task will be created for sales manager
      to click. This is similar to the earlier release where change in SAM or OB reflects
      on the CMT and any changes are adjusted with the profit margin on the cost sheet.
      This will help us in analysing post shipment costings and understand what styles
      are suitable to us over a period of time</p>
